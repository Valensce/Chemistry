# Chemistry Equations
A chemical equation shows you which compounds are present before the reaction (reactants), and which compounds are present after the reaction has occurred (products). For example: <br><br>

Just like a mathematical equation, where the numbers on each side of the equals sign must be equal in value, the number of each type of atom in a chemical equation must be the same on each side of the arrow. The arrow acts like an equals sign when balancing equations.<br><br>
In a chemical reaction, the atoms can rearrange to form different compounds, but atoms cannot be created or destroyed! This principle is called the Law of Conservation of Mass. The Law of Conservation of Mass states that the amount of mass we put into a reaction must be the same as the amount of mass we get out of a reaction.<br><br>
Before you can balance an unbalanced equation, you need to be able to determine the number of each type of atom present in a compound, and how that changes when a number is added in front of the compound.<br><br>
Subscript numbers (small numbers at the bottom) refer to the atoms they come after. If there is no subscript number, it means there is only one of that atom.<br><br>
Big numbers in front of a compound indicate that the whole compound needs to be multiplied by that number. If there is no number, there is just one of that compound.<br><br>
The brackets indicate that the following subscript number applies to everything inside the brackets.<br><br>
